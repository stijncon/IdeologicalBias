# IdeologicalBias
Notebooks with the code for an agent based model about ideological bias. Each version gets uploaded here before we meet to discuss it and decide on changes.

# Data

The files part_0 - part_4 are the results of a batch run (pickled dataframe cut into smaller chunks to upload here), and used to display the results in a binder notebook.
